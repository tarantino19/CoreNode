Basics of Networking

Learn TCP - all protocols are built on top of it.
e.g. http, ftp, ssh, email protocols, etc.

Use when i wanna share an info to another computer

1 - In the old days, flash drive, floppy disk, etc
2 - Today, after a cable -  switch  - networking card in the computer (w/ mac addresses)
Via cables - need to send via packets - to switch - > another computer
How to connect a network of computers to another network of computers?
we can use ROUTERS that used ip addresses (automatically assigned by the router to computer)

This is basically what the internet is, interconnected computers.

There's physical connection even in wifi/wireless use...
e.g. wifi - connected ro a router - that router is connected to one local provider/ISP internet service provider - then that one local provider may be connected to the world.

Router today - as a switch, cables, wifi.

What does these cables do? Just moving zeros and ones together.
wifi - travellin to waves/air
*****

You can make any machine a server. 

search for "how to find my machien ip addresses

ip addresses has to be accurate.

UNDERSTANDING NETWORKING LAYERS

****

5 - Application Layer - Data - NODEJS - as a dev, we figure out if we use tcp/udp

1-4 for Network Engineers

4 - Transport Layer - Segments - e2e connections, TCP/UDP - main protocols

3 - Network Layer (packets, ip addresses) - Packets - ip ad, path destination

2 - Data Link Layer - Frames - Mac addresses

1 - Physical Layer (cables, network card) - Bits - Signals and Binary Transmission


****************
CREATING A SIMPLE TCP APPLICATION
****************

Use Wireshark for seeing more data packets
-wireshark captures every single byte

****************
TRANSPORT LAYER
****************

TCP - makes sure that data is not changing - every single bit intending to send is actually sent over.

UDP is about just making sure data is sent.
UDP is more about speed.

TCP - 3 WAY HANDSHAKE

A will send, B will acknowledge

UDP will add its own headers

each layer will add its own headers.

//CHAT APP SOCKETS
// 1 client 1 SOCKETS

- this example isnt secure

- kali linux for publicwifi hacking?
