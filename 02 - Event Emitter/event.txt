What is an event emitter?

A way to deal with async nodejs, a pattern, for the code to be more readable and more manageable.

Heavily used in different parts of nodejs

EVENT - a signal that something has happened in our application.

http - for web server
http - request - raises an event - our job is to respond to that event
,reading that request and responding to that event.

const EventEmitter = require("events");
const emitter = new EventEmitter

emitter.on ('messageLogged' (callbackfunction ()=> {})) - register a listener, interested in that event  - same associated.addListener
emitter.emit ('messageLogged') - emit - making a noise, signalling
